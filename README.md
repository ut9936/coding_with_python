# Automated Food Grain Protection

## Introduction
Agriculture plays a vital role in increasing any nation's economy. India being an agriculture country; where 50% population depends on farming, **storage and protection** of grains plays a crucial role in developing nation's economy. In the process of grain storage, temperature and humidity are major environmental factors that can influence directly on the quality of the Grain. Hence, there is a necessity to monitor the vital parameters continuously during storage and communicate the status to the manager in real time which becomes challenging.The traditional methods require continuous human efforts which is practically not feasible. There is a need for smart grain management system with automation which can monitor environmental parameters such as **temperature, humidity and rain** and give status updates and warnings to the manager.

## Grain protection system description

On the whole, the protection system mainly consists of *a microprocessor(ARDUINO UNO), a communication module(Bluetooth module),various types of sensors(rain, humidity, temperature and moisture) and protection mechanism*. The microprocessor is linked with **Bluetooth module** for sending status updates to the manager. The manager will receive updates from the Bluetooth module through a mobile application. There are future plans to extend the communication range by replacing the Bluetooth module with a GSM module. The manager can set the limits of environmental parameters manually to get warnings on the mobile application. The sensors are directly connected to ARDUINO board through jumper wires. The protection mechanism consists of two servo motors.

Working mechanism of the system Data of various parameters; namely temperature, humidity and rainfall, will be collected chiefly by the sensors. The working of rain sensor is based on
